# DataScience_and_ML_Projects

This repository is home to a few data science and machine learning projects I have completed. Here the the descriptions for each.
- GLM_proj.R: this poject explores some linear models and how to arrive at the optiomal degree for an approxamating polynomial using cross-validation.
- BayesClassifier_and_LDA.R: this project takes some randomly genereated data points based on some gaussian distributions and uses the Baye's Classifier to draw decision boundaries. The BC boundaries are compared to the boundaries achivied using Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.
- SVM_PostOffice_Data.R: the goal of this project is to train a support vector machine to predict a handwritten number from a 16x16 grid of pixels. Through cross-validation, the optimal value of the cost parameter and the appropriate kernel are found.
- final_project.R: this project seeks to classify activies (SITTING, STANDING, LAYING, WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS) useing smartphone gyroscope and accelerometer data. Several classification methods are used including SVM, Logistic Regression, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and Feed-Formard Neural Networks. Principal Component Analysis and Kernal PCA were used to reduce the dimensionality of the data set to aid in classification efforts.
