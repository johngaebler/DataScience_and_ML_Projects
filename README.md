# DataScience_and_ML_Projects

This repository is home to a few data science and machine learning projects I have completed. Here the the descriptions for each:
- GLM_proj.R - this poject explores some linear models and how to arrive at the optiomal degree for an approxamating polynomial using cross-validation
- BayesClassifier_and_LDA - this project takes some randomly genereated data points based on some gaussian distributions and uses the Baye's Classifier to draw decision boundaries. The BC boundaries are compared to the boundaries achivied using Linear Discriminant Analysis
